I had another round of exchange with Vinoth Ramachandra on the Israel-Palestine conflict. I did not intend to write another piece on Ramachandra but I am compelled to do so because he would not allow my comment pointing out his basic factual errors on his blog. So here goes. 

This round started with Ramachandra's most recent blogpost titled, [Kiss or Kick Ass?](https://vinothramachandra.wordpress.com/2025/02/12/kiss-or-kick-ass/). The article contained blatant falsehoods. This is typical for Ramachandra whenever he writes on Israel, as I have pointed out in detail [here](https://elihoole.github.io/2024/06/23/subverting-ramachandra-myths.html). But, in my view, this piece was the clearest articulation yet of Ramachandra's Jew hate, in writing. Now, Ramachandra's Jew hate -- or, antisemitism -- is something that I alluded to in my last piece but did not explicitly name and condemn. After the recent blogpost though, I decided to do so. 

I replied to his blogpost thus: 

>" Vinoth, your Jew hate is predictably making you thick.

> 'We are shown the faces and names of Israeli hostages, but never those of Palestinian prisoners who have been tortured and imprisoned for decades. The former are human, the latter are presumably not.'

> You see the Israeli hostages because Hamas releases them in vile, choreographed propaganda stunts. They are broadcast on your favourite, unbiased Al Jazeera.

> Your Jew hate also moves you to paint the Israelis as somehow more evil than the rest of the world. That’s the purpose of your Uri Avnery quote: a specious rationalization of your ‘uniquely evil Jews fantasy’ by way of their Holocaust experience.

> If you exercised logic, you would realise that Avnery himself is a counterpoint to the broad and sweeping generalizations of the quotation."
