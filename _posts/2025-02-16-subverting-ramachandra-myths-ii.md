I had another round of exchange with Vinoth Ramachandra on the Israel-Palestine conflict. I did not intend to write another piece on Ramachandra but I am compelled to do so because he would not allow my comment pointing out his basic factual errors on his blog. So here goes. 

It started with Ramachandra's most recent blogpost titled, Kiss or Kick Ass? [link](https://vinothramachandra.wordpress.com/2025/02/12/kiss-or-kick-ass/). The article contained blatant falsehoods. This is typical for Ramachandra, as I have pointed out in detail here [link](https://elihoole.github.io/2024/06/23/subverting-ramachandra-myths.html)
